        <h3>Ogun State the Gateway State</h3>

        <p>Ogun State was carved out of the old Western State by the military administration of General Murtala Muhammed and General Olusegun Obasanjo in 1976. Ogun State is otherwise known as the Gateway State. This is in recognition of its pioneering role in education, medicine, law and divinity, on the one hand, and its strategic position as the link by road, rail, air and sea to the rest of the country. Apart from Abeokuta, the capital, which is an important market centre-and a terminus of the roads and railways coming from Lagos and other parts of the country, there are also major towns and communities like Sagamu, Ijebu-Ode, Ilaro and others that can serve as good markets for products of the mining industry in Ogun State.</p>
